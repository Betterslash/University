                            <p>Garrosh was the acting Warchief of the entire Horde following the
                            events of Cataclysm and his rule has already been tainted with
                            great conflict and death. Garrosh is a very different ruler from
                            Thrall - while Thrall has always been compassionate and well-liked
                            by his allies Garrosh has always been a brutal orc who values the
                            old orc value of "death before dishonor". Garrosh's hatred of the
                            Alliance, however, is extremely evident, and he shows almost
                            xenophobic hatred for the Alliance and their allies as well as
                            those he judges as weak or disloyal: under Garrosh's new rule the
                            Horde has become much more militant and the motto of "death before
                            dishonor" is now quickly becoming a way of life as Garrosh and his
                            loyalists are prone to "dismissing" those that displease them via
                            instant execution. The only race Garrosh loves is his own race,
                            the orcs. When he rose to power however he began limiting the
                            rights of the other races, forcing them to live in segregated
                            neighborhoods in <b>Orgrimmar</b> and stealing their valuables.
                            Garrosh's goals seems to point to eradicating the Alliance and all
                            other enemies of the Horde, so that he can become the undisputed
                            and unquestioned ruler of <b>Azeroth</b>.

                            Lady Sylvanas Windrunner, also referred to as "the Dark Lady" and
                            "the Banshee Queen" during her rule, as well as "the Banshee"
                            following the Fourth War, is the former Warchief of the Horde and
                            former supreme ruler of the Forsaken, one of the most powerful
                            factions of undead on Azeroth. In life, Sylvanas was the
                            ranger-general of Silvermoon, whose leadership acumen and martial
                            prowess were without equal. During the Third War, she bravely
                            defended Quel'Thalas from a Scourge invasion led by the death
                            knight Arthas Menethil. Ultimately, however, Sylvanas fell in
                            battle. Rather than honor the ranger-general with a quick death,
                            Arthas ripped out her soul and transformed it into a banshee: a
                            cunning and vengeful agent of the Lich <b>King</b> empowered by
                            hate.

                            Thrall (birthname Go'el), son of Durotan (born the year 0 ADP),
                            was the Warchief of the restored orcish Horde and ruler of the red
                            land of Durotar in Kalimdor. Before the Cataclysm, he was Warchief
                            of all the Horde, but temporarily gave leadership to Garrosh
                            Hellscream in order to lead the Earthen Ring's effort with Farseer
                            Nobundo against the Twilight's Hammer cult and elemental imbalance
                            afflicting <b>Azeroth</b> caused by the awakening of Deathwing.
                            After Garrosh's tyranny was overthrown, Thrall renounced his claim
                            on the title of Warchief and instead gave the position to his
                            close friend and ally, Vol'jin. To friends, Thrall is warm and
                            generous, freely swapping stories and information. Hospitality is
                            extended to everyone, but Thrall expects all visitors to
                            contribute in some way to Orgrimmar’s survival. Visiting hunters
                            often bring meat or fur in exchange for refuge from the elements,
                            and human traders from Theramore Isle periodically bring casks of
                            salt ale and seed for crops. While in <b>Orgrimmar</b>, visitors
                            are under Thrall’s protection and he will not tolerate any threats
                            or violence against them. Thrall is a natural-born leader. He is
                            rarely alone, and in battle often spends much of his time
                            directing his troops. In solo combat his tactics are subtle. He
                            mixes a judicious amount of melee with powerful spellcasting to
                            great effect.

                      The shadow hunter Vol'jin (occasionally called Vol'jin Darkspear
                      and referred to by the Shado-Pan as Vol'jian), son of Sen'jin, was
                      the Warchief of the Horde, as well as Chieftain of the Darkspear
                      tribe and rightful ruler of Durotar and the Echo Isles. Vol'jin
                      had sworn to do everything in his power to lead the Darkspear
                      tribe just as his late father, Sen'jin, would have. For years
                      Vol'jin resided in <b>Orgrimmar</b>, offering strategic advice to
                      then-Warchief Thrall and assisting with critical operations such
                      as retaking the Undercity after the Forsaken bastion had been
                      usurped by Grand Apothecary Putress and the dreadlord Varimathras.
                      During the Cataclysm, however, Vol'jin came into conflict with the
                      Horde's new warchief, Garrosh Hellscream. Alienated by the orc's
                      extremism and lust for war, the troll leader departed Orgrimmar
                      and took up residence on Darkspear Isle. Despite his conflict with
                      the new warchief, Vol'jin remained loyal to the <b>Horde</b> and
                      opposed the efforts of the Zandalari to create a new troll empire
                      in the wake of the Cataclysm. However, death would not be the end
                      of Vol'jin's story.
