            <h1>Garrosh</h1>
            <img src="assets/garrosh-img-asset.png" />
            <p>
              Garrosh was the acting Warchief of the entire Horde following the
              events of Cataclysm and his rule has already been tainted with
              great conflict and death. Garrosh is a very different ruler from
              Thrall - while Thrall has always been compassionate and well-liked
              by his allies Garrosh has always been a brutal orc who values the
              old orc value of "death before dishonor". Garrosh's hatred of the
              Alliance, however, is extremely evident, and he shows almost
              xenophobic hatred for the Alliance and their allies as well as
              those he judges as weak or disloyal: under Garrosh's new rule the
              Horde has become much more militant and the motto of "death before
              dishonor" is now quickly becoming a way of life as Garrosh and his
              loyalists are prone to "dismissing" those that displease them via
              instant execution. The only race Garrosh loves is his own race,
              the orcs. When he rose to power however he began limiting the
              rights of the other races, forcing them to live in segregated
              neighborhoods in <b>Orgrimmar</b> and stealing their valuables.
              Garrosh's goals seems to point to eradicating the Alliance and all
              other enemies of the Horde, so that he can become the undisputed
              and unquestioned ruler of <b>Azeroth</b>.

            <p>
              Lady Sylvanas Windrunner, also referred to as "the Dark Lady" and
              "the Banshee Queen" during her rule, as well as "the Banshee"
              following the Fourth War, is the former Warchief of the Horde and
              former supreme ruler of the Forsaken, one of the most powerful
              factions of undead on Azeroth. In life, Sylvanas was the
              ranger-general of Silvermoon, whose leadership acumen and martial
              prowess were without equal. During the Third War, she bravely
              defended Quel'Thalas from a Scourge invasion led by the death
              knight Arthas Menethil. Ultimately, however, Sylvanas fell in
              battle. Rather than honor the ranger-general with a quick death,
              Arthas ripped out her soul and transformed it into a banshee: a
              cunning and vengeful agent of the Lich <b>King</b> empowered by
              hate.

            <h1>Thrall</h1>
            <img src="assets/thrall-asset-ConvertImage.png" />
            <p>
              Thrall (birthname Go'el), son of Durotan (born the year 0 ADP),
              was the Warchief of the restored orcish Horde and ruler of the red
              land of Durotar in Kalimdor. Before the Cataclysm, he was Warchief
              of all the Horde, but temporarily gave leadership to Garrosh
              Hellscream in order to lead the Earthen Ring's effort with Farseer
              Nobundo against the Twilight's Hammer cult and elemental imbalance
              afflicting <b>Azeroth</b> caused by the awakening of Deathwing.
              After Garrosh's tyranny was overthrown, Thrall renounced his claim
              on the title of Warchief and instead gave the position to his
              close friend and ally, Vol'jin. To friends, Thrall is warm and
              generous, freely swapping stories and information. Hospitality is
              extended to everyone, but Thrall expects all visitors to
              contribute in some way to Orgrimmar’s survival. Visiting hunters
              often bring meat or fur in exchange for refuge from the elements,
              and human traders from Theramore Isle periodically bring casks of
              salt ale and seed for crops. While in <b>Orgrimmar</b>, visitors
              are under Thrall’s protection and he will not tolerate any threats
              or violence against them. Thrall is a natural-born leader. He is
              rarely alone, and in battle often spends much of his time
              directing his troops. In solo combat his tactics are subtle. He
              mixes a judicious amount of melee with powerful spellcasting to
              great effect.

            <h1>Vol'Jin</h1>
            <img src="assets/vol-jin-asset-ConvertImage.png" />
            <p>
              The shadow hunter Vol'jin (occasionally called Vol'jin Darkspear
              and referred to by the Shado-Pan as Vol'jian), son of Sen'jin, was
              the Warchief of the Horde, as well as Chieftain of the Darkspear
              tribe and rightful ruler of Durotar and the Echo Isles. Vol'jin
              had sworn to do everything in his power to lead the Darkspear
              tribe just as his late father, Sen'jin, would have. For years
              Vol'jin resided in <b>Orgrimmar</b>, offering strategic advice to
              then-Warchief Thrall and assisting with critical operations such
              as retaking the Undercity after the Forsaken bastion had been
              usurped by Grand Apothecary Putress and the dreadlord Varimathras.
              During the Cataclysm, however, Vol'jin came into conflict with the
              Horde's new warchief, Garrosh Hellscream. Alienated by the orc's
              extremism and lust for war, the troll leader departed Orgrimmar
              and took up residence on Darkspear Isle. Despite his conflict with
              the new warchief, Vol'jin remained loyal to the <b>Horde</b> and
              opposed the efforts of the Zandalari to create a new troll empire
              in the wake of the Cataclysm. However, death would not be the end
              of Vol'jin's story.
