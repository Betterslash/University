Selection σ:
    Access paths:
        --> File scan
        --> Index scan matching selection condition 'C'
                    --> Matching meaning the index can be used to retreive only the tuples matching 'C'
                    --> Hash index works fine when search condition is =
                            -->If hash index, the condition must contain all indexed cols
                    --> For a tree index operators may vary and also the search condition must contain PREFIXES of indexed values
        --> Selectivity of an access path is defined by the number of pages that is retreived

Joins ⊗: 
    1) Implementations --> iteration    ==> Simple/Page-Oriented nested loops <-- a
                                        ==> Block nested loops                <-- b
                       --> indexing     ==> Index Nested loops Joins          <-- c 
                       --> partitioning ==> Sort-Merge Joins                  <-- d

    *M, N page numbers of the joined tables
     pe, ps number of records per page 

    a -> Complexity = M + pe * (M * N)
      -> Complexity = M + M * N = M * (N + 1)
    
    b -> Complexity = scan of outer table + number of blocks in outer table * scan of inner table
            --> No. of blocks = [No. pages outer / Size of block]
    
    c -> Complexity = M + ( (M*pE) * cost of finding corresponding records in S)
            --> cost of finding corresponding records in S = 1.2 for Hash Index
                                                           = 2-4 for B+ tree index
