1 -> read-commited
2 -> read uncommited 
3 -> repeatable read 
4 -> snapshot
5 -> serializable

!! Dirty writes aren't alolowed at any of the following isolation levels !!


1 --> Transactions can read data modified by other ongoing transactions 
  --> it is the lowest degree of isolation 
  --> no Shared locks when reading data

2 --> Transactions can only read commited data 
  --> an object read by T(denotes current transaction) 
  can be changed by another transaction while T is in progress
  --> Transactions requires an Exclusive lock in order to modify data
  --> Exclusive locks are released at the end of the transaction
  --> Shared locks are imediately released

3 --> Transactions can only read commited data
  --> objects read by T cannot be changed by any other 
  transactions while T is ongoing 
  --> Transactions need X/S locks for reading an writing objects
  --> X/S Locks released only at the end of the transaction

4 -->
